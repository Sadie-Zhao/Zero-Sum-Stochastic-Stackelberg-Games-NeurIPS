# Zero-Sum-Stochastic-Stackelberg-Games-NeurIPS
This is the code repository for the paper "Zero-Sum Stochastic Stackelberg Games" accpeted to neurIPS 2022.

There are two folders contained in this repository.
1. The folder _Without_Interest_Rates_ contains the notebooks that contain code for experiment in the setup without interest rates.
 - _JAX+(utility_type)_Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings.ipynb_ contains the main code for experiment in the setup without interest rates and with utility_type.
 - _JAX+(utility_type)_Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings_Resulr_Analysis.ipynb_ contains the result analysis section for the for experiment in the setup without interest rates and with utility_type, including generating the value function plots and computing the exploitability. 
 
2. The folder _With_Interest_Rates_ contains the notebooks that contain code for experiment in the setup with interest rates.
 - _big+ir+(utility_type)_Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings.ipynb_ contains the main code for experiment in the setup with interest rates and with utility_type.
 - _big+ir+(utility_type)_Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings_Resulr_Analysis.ipynb_ contains the result analysis section for the for experiment in the setup with interest rates and with utility_type, including generating the value function plots and computing the exploitability.
