# Zero-Sum-Stochastic-Stackelberg-Games-NeurIPS
This is the code repository for the paper "Zero-Sum Stochastic Stackelberg Games".

There are four notebooks contained in this repository.
1. The notebook _Stochastic_Fisher_without_savings.ipynb_ contains the main code for experiment in the setup without savings. 
2. The notebook _Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings.ipynb_ contains the main code for experiment in the setup with savings. 
3. The notebook _Stochastic_Fisher_without_savings_Resulr_Analysis.ipynb_ contains the result analysis section for the for experiment in the setup without savings, including generating the value function plots and computing the exploitability. 
4. The notebook _Stochastic_Fisher_with_savings_Resulr_Analysis.ipynb_ contains the result analysis section for the for experiment in the setup with savings, including generating the value function plots and computing the exploitability.
